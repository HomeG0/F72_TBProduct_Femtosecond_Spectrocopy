# F72 Experiment FemtoGroup
A small Origin Labtalk based GUI snippet to help with analysis of files obtained during F72 Experiment


## Instructions:

1) Download all the files in this repo by clicking on "Code" on top-right corner and then on "Download zip" and then extract the zip file into a single folder.
2) Move the files obtained during the experiment into this new folder and open the Origin file  (one with .opju extension).
4) Rest intructions can be followed from within that origin file.

### Quick Fixes:

If there are some errors saying "...." not found or "...." not defined, then press reset button and try once again.
